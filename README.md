Analyzing stock price action and returns using Yahoo Finance data, exploring inter-industry correlations, and building predictive models with LSTM and ARIMA/SARIMA.

# Stock Price Analysis and Prediction

This project uses data from Yahoo Finance to analyze stock market behavior, evaluate returns, and identify correlations between industries. Additionally, it implements predictive models for stock prices and returns using both traditional time series models (ARIMA/SARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM).

## Features

- **Data Collection**:
  - Automated retrieval of historical stock data using `yfinance`.

- **Analysis**:
  - Statistical analysis of price action and returns.
  - Trend and seasonality decomposition.
  - Inter-industry correlation insights.

- **Modeling**:
  - Baseline predictions using ARIMA/SARIMA.
  - Advanced predictions using LSTM for price and return forecasting.

## Project Goals

1. Understand price action and return patterns across various stocks and industries.
2. Explore inter-industry correlations to uncover relationships between different sectors.
3. Build robust prediction models to forecast stock prices and returns.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Mohtat/stock-price-prediction.git
